# Gin Hello Server

This is a minimal HTTP server built using the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework in Go. It serves a single `/` endpoint that returns a JSON greeting. Created as part of **Week 1** of my Backend Developer Roadmap to explore web server design using frameworks in Go.
