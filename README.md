# 🧭 Backend Developer Roadmap (Go & Python) – Accelerated Journey

Welcome to my documentation repo for completing the [roadmap.sh backend developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) in 5 weeks!

This repo tracks my structured learning journey, practical projects, and reflections as I progress toward becoming a strong backend engineer – with a focus on **Go** and **Python**. The goal is to build valuable backend skills, contribute meaningfully to my internship, and prepare for a long-term role in backend development.

## 🗓️ Timeline

**Start Date:** May 28, 2025  
**Target Completion:** Early July 2025  
**Duration:** ~5 weeks  
**Primary Languages:** Go, Python  
**Tools/Tech:** FastAPI, Gin, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Docker, GitHub Actions, JWT, CI/CD, Redis (optional)

## 📁 Weekly Folder Structure

Each folder contains:
- Mini-projects or code samples
- Notes and reflections
- Setup instructions, READMEs, and diagrams

| Folder      | Focus Area                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
